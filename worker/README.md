# offeraio-worker

The Cloudflare Worker behind OfferAIO. Live at
`https://offeraio-worker.tobybergerbusiness.workers.dev`.

Until 2026-07-19 this Worker existed **only as a deployed script** — there was no copy
in the repo. `src/index.js` was vendored from the live deployment (verified
byte-for-byte, md5 `46320584d9efd35f821709df1aec264d`) so that changes are reviewable
and can't be silently lost. Edit it here, not in the Cloudflare dashboard.

## Endpoints

| Route                 | Method | Purpose                                    |
| --------------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| `/health`             | GET    | Liveness probe                             |
| `/cover`              | POST   | Cover-letter generation (Anthropic) — Pro  |
| `/rank`               | POST   | Resume↔listing ranking (OpenAI) — Pro      |
| `/stripe/webhook`     | POST   | Stripe events → license records            |
| `/license/verify`     | POST   | `{key, installId?}` → plan + quota         |
| `/license/activate`   | POST   | `{key, installId}` → bind an install       |
| `/license/by-session` | GET    | `?session_id=cs_…` → key, for success page |

### `/license/verify`

```
POST {"key": "OA-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX", "installId": "<uuid>"}
->   {"ok":true, "active":true,  "plan":"pro",  "quota":250, "status":"active",
      "periodEnd":1762592000000, "installs":1, "maxInstalls":3}
->   {"ok":true, "active":false, "plan":"free", "quota":50, "reason":"canceled"}
```

Always 200, even for a bad key — the extension has one code path: trust `active`, else
fall back to Free. `reason` is one of `malformed`, `unknown`, `expired`, `canceled`,
`device_limit`.

The key format is `OA-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX` in Crockford base32 (no I/L/O/U), 60 bits of
entropy. Input is normalised, so lowercase, missing dashes, and `I`→`1` / `O`→`0`
typos all resolve.

### Webhook

Signature is verified with `crypto.subtle` HMAC-SHA256 over `` `${t}.${rawBody}` ``, 300s
tolerance — the Stripe SDK is not used because its `constructEvent` needs sync crypto that
Workers doesn't have. Events are deduped on `evt:<id>` for 3 days. A handler error returns
500 **without** marking the event, so Stripe retries rather than dropping a payment.

Point the Stripe endpoint at `https://offeraio-worker.tobybergerbusiness.workers.dev/stripe/webhook`
and subscribe to: `checkout.session.completed`, `invoice.paid`,
`customer.subscription.created`, `customer.subscription.updated`,
`customer.subscription.deleted`. (`invoice.payment_failed` may be subscribed; it is
deliberately a no-op — see PROJECT.md §10.)

## Tests

`npm test --prefix worker` — 38 cases, no network, no Stripe account, no wrangler runtime
(billing.js sticks to Web-standard APIs so it runs on plain Node). Covers forged and
replayed signatures, out-of-order delivery, dropped-webhook expiry, dunning, and the
install limit. CI runs them before every deploy.

### `/cover` and `/rank` require Pro

Both spend real money on the Anthropic/OpenAI keys, so both need an active licence and
are metered server-side. Callers must include the key in the POST body:

```
POST /cover {"key":"OA-…","installId":"…","company":"…","role":"…","profile":{…}}
->  200 {"ok":true,"letter":"…","used":12,"limit":250}
->  402 {"ok":false,"error":"Pro required","reason":"unknown"}
->  429 {"ok":false,"error":"Pro required","reason":"monthly_limit","used":250}
```

This is the **only** enforcement in the system that isn't client-side. The extension's
submission counter lives in `chrome.storage.local` and is trivially resettable; that's
accepted (PROJECT.md §10). Metering here is what actually bounds spend.

The counter is a read-modify-write on KV and therefore not atomic — concurrent requests
can lose an increment. That risks a handful of extra generations at the month boundary,
which is much cheaper than making it exact.

> local Electron engine on `127.0.0.1:7717`. Any future caller must send the key.

## Deploy

Pushing to `main` with changes under `worker/` runs `.github/workflows/deploy-worker.yml`.
Manually: `npx wrangler deploy` from this directory.

Validate without deploying: `npx wrangler deploy --dry-run`.

## Secrets

Set in Cloudflare, never in this repo. They are stored separately from the script and
**survive `wrangler deploy`**.

```
wrangler secret put ANTHROPIC_API_KEY      # cover letters
wrangler secret put OPENAI_API_KEY         # optional, needed by /rank
wrangler secret put STRIPE_SECRET_KEY      # Phase 1
wrangler secret put STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET  # Phase 1
```

GitHub needs one repo secret, `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` ("Edit Cloudflare Workers" template).

## KV

`LICENSES` → namespace `40fb8a5ef93143fc9d0ad49592a7dc64` (`offeraio-licenses`).
Bound but unused until Phase 1. Key layout is documented in `wrangler.toml`.

## Caveat on the first deploy

The Cloudflare API doesn't expose the live Worker's binding list, so `wrangler.toml`
was reconstructed from what the source actually reads (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`,
`OPENAI_API_KEY` — both secrets) plus the new KV binding. If any binding was added
through the dashboard and isn't referenced in the code, the first `wrangler deploy`
will drop it. Check the dashboard's Settings → Bindings before the first deploy, and
confirm `/health` and a real `/cover` call afterwards.
